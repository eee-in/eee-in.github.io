As far as the final points of writing for the grant proposal are concerned, I have only to add in some missing formatting and information necessary to round out the project as best I can. This project in relation to Digital Humanities has been challenging because of how little the topic is mentioned in the mainstream media. As far as what I have developed further, I have developed the Grant Narrative to focus its approach on how this switch from physical media and home releases to streaming services potentially leads to an environment in which the consumer has little to no true ownership of the media which they pay for. A focus more on the history of physical media and home releases as well as how the slow decrease due to streaming services affects the consumer’s right to ownership. One of the more interesting aspects of this topic is how the consumer base has more or less bought into this without thinking about how this will affect the media landscape. 

Moreover, there are some people who believe that virtually nothing will change without physical media like blu-ray and DVD’s. Writing a grant like this has given me a new perspective on how technological advancements affect culture. To widen the scope for this explanation, our greater global society never had an honest discussion about how social media could be weaponized to sway public opinion or even to deceive entire populations into thinking negatively about a person or product. This oversight is a striking example of how, up to this point, technology has progressed faster than people can even begin to imagine and debate on its positives and negatives. To quote __Jurassic Park__, “they were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should”, a perfect thematic display of how even society of the 90s, and of the time period of when Michael Crighton originally wrote the novel, were grappling with the steadily increasing pace of technological advancement. 

While the issue of physical media is relatively new and definitely not as “life or death” an issue as social media manipulation or resurrecting extinct species is, it is important for individual rights. For decades, people have been able to go out and buy physical copies of media pieces they enjoy. People who enjoyed TV/movies/music had collections of these physical copies to play at their leisure. Now with the advent of streaming services, there is an even lower bar to entry for enjoying content; this can likely be attributed to the lack of any physical labor (actually inserting the disc into a player) that goes into watching streamed content. However, that trade off may come with a lack of freedom or ownership over the content people enjoy. Take something as successful as __The Mandalorian__, a series that has revitalized interest in the __Star Wars__ IP from television directors and actors; this television show has no physical home release beyond its availability on the __Disney+__ streaming service. This concept of exclusive content effectively ostracizes consumers who enjoy good television, and psychologically strong-arms them into buying into how every many streaming services own the variously licensed properties they enjoy. Doing this project has allowed me to personally reckon with my own views in regard to the ethics of exclusive content and streaming services, and has given me a greater appreciation and sense of respect for those who do these sorts of digital humanities projects for a living. The amount of research and dedication it takes to bringing these topics and designs to fruition is simply impressive and inspiring.
