	The grant project is honestly one of the most interesting topics I have researched in my academic career thus far. Mainly because of the wide variety of opinions on the subject; the jury has not reached a consensus on whether or not the disappearance of physical media is truly a negative in today’s society. Scholars have only recently started to chart the timeline of streamed media’s arc of increase during the last decade and a half, however only a few are focusing on the long term results this can have on our already crowded and controlled media landscape. Using the information at hand, my podcast could propose a position to showing how lower sales of DVDs and other forms of physical media can be attributed to the rise of streaming services. The timeline of this change is also very interesting, all starting with the advent of the video store. From there it went to rental stores such as Blockbuster, until a little known mail-in rental service called _Netflix_ started a streaming website to stream licensed shows for a subscription fee. From then, Netflix subscriptions skyrocketed, and the service found the funds for their own original programming; _House of Cards_, which garnered multiple accolades at several in several categories of award shows. More and more services started popping up, from Amazon to Hulu and now existing live television networks like NBC are making the switch to streaming services. What is obvious to the observer is a growing incentivization for television services and networks to develop their own streaming subscription services, with original programming to entice consumers to buy into the subscription service. Services like Disney+ and AppleTV have also shown a growing trend in these services that buy exclusive rights for streaming certain media. Programming exclusive to Disney+ and AppleTV are not being made with the intention to allocate funds for a home release of physical copies; even many old Disney films and TV programs have had their home releases either significantly reduced or altogether discontinued. I will use the studies finished on streaming offerings from strictly display media to strictly tune streaming offerings to help my personal studies at the decline of bodily media and the lower incentive for domestic releases. The literature worried will embody years of now no longer best video streaming however additionally streaming tune, news, sports, and different sorts of entertainment. Every episode will feature an individual component of the upward track of streaming media, from its beginnings as a commercial rental enterprise to the crowded media powerhouse, and the way that that landscape has affected how consumers buy and watch media which we consume. Ideally, this podcast will make a contribution to the continuing dialogue of streaming offerings and simply how a good deal our society values possession and ownership over the media we consume. What has been somewhat difficult is the lack of substantial scholarship in the digital humanities category as it pertains to this particular topic. We are living through a particularly interesting yet troubling time, in which new technologies and services are being developed faster than society can really discuss whether or not they are a positive or negative influence on society. Only recently have we been discussing topics like streaming services, and how these companies are essentially monopolizing an art form and the means of production for it. So far it has been limited to talk-show discussions and radio interviews, yet slowly but surely the scholarship is catching up.
