title: About Me
---

I am a senior English major with a writing concentration and a film studies minor. While I'm taking this class to fulfill a major req, I am interested in how I can use this knowledge towards my major.  
I previously have worked as a writer and copy editor for _The Captain's Log_, CNU's student-run newspaper, am currently writing a collection of short stories, and have written and illustrated a children's picturebook.
When it comes to the kinds of stories I want to see or write, I find stories written for who I am very boring. My hope is to write works that connect with people on an emotional level as well as encouraging an open perspective on life.
I also have a Bernese Mountain Dog named **D'Artagnan**, after the chief character in Alexander Dumas' novel _The Three Musketeers_.
