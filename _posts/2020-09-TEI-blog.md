title: Transcribing in TEI
---

  _The Yellow Wall-Paper_ , written by Charlotte Perkins Steton, is one of the most important works counted among early American feminist literature. Lauded for its approach towards the oppressive attitudes by men towards women during the 19th century; the story revolves around a young woman who, after being forbidden from performing any mentally stimulating activities in her own home, falls into a pit of despair and psychosis after prolonged observation and stimulus from nothing but the wallpaper. The section which I transcribed on the XML document using the TEI method of digital transcription was one of the first sections in which the character first examines the eponymous wallpaper in excruciating detail. This section was interesting to me because it is one of the first indicators to the reader that the wife (main character) is beginning to unravel under her husband's oppressive treatment. The in-depth description and detail regarding the wallpaper is immediately and jarringly followed by a striking condemnation of her husband's treatment and a relishing in her journal writing: the singular mode of self-expression.

The initial notation of this section was relatively straightforward when it came to simple things like the beginnings of paragraphs and column heads. There were not too many XML coding hurdles to leap when it came to transcribing the section of the narrative into the Oxygen reader. While it would have been simpler to copy and paste the text into the separate lines, I felt the experience of transcribing line by line instead of simply copy and pasting very cathartic and carried a productive feel to it as well, as ridiculous and trite as that may sound to someone who may very well be in the same field (English) as I am trying to be in.

The prospect of computer coding an entire section of a document seemed frightenting and dismaying to someone who very likely is still harboring residual stress from years of trying to pass computer coding classes for a major they didn't realize they hated (physics, me). But after hearing the tutorials from my professor and actually getting the coding started, all that stress melted away and the Oxygen XML language was fairly simple to understand and the transcription seemed to flow from my thoughts to my fingers like water down a faucet. im

The coding process itself was very simple, given that there were no errors to correct or any other issues I would have had to take into account coding-wise. The process, given that I typed it out instead of pasting it into the XML document, gave me an appreciation for the prose I was transcribing. The stark difference between the in-depth specific detail in the wife's observations of the wallpaper, the language used to express the confusing and disturbing feelings it illicited from her, and her condemnation of her husband's treatment of her all worked in concert to create a piece that was very stirring and telling of the oppressive conditions facing women during this time period.
